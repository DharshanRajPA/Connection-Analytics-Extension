# Connection-Analytics-Extension

## Analyze all the Linkedin connections and recommend the best customer client connections for product sales

### steps thought for implementation

(i)should write basic front end code for removing the ad section and appending the new section elemnt created with the same styles

(ii)should write the backend code to scraping and fetching the data from linkedin and store it in the local storage by using the web-containers instead of our code runniing up on the server and making the resources costly 

(iii)also send the responses they got by using api to our company service to store it in the datbase with ours as the 
storing data is cheap as when compared to compute it in real time

(iv)also we can also scarpe and provide the data to the clients in our fast cloud infrastructure if needed as some premium service with much more data analytics feature

(v)in a tldr, the clients provide the data for both them and also for us so that whenever a client searches for user to scrape it first searches for the data in the local storage(caching makes fastre) and if not we search for the data for them in our database or if it is not available with us also they user will scrape and get data for them and for us through api calls so that we can able to store all the data from customers and use it even when we does not use expensive computing resouces to scrape at all here in this case users will be able to scrape the data for us and give in which there is a mutual benefit respectively

i dont know whetear this is feasible or not so please kindly give your suggestion opinion about what can be done furthur sir
